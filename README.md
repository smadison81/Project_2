This project is based on Order Management System. It involves user entering the order at a kiosk, finalizing it and submitting the order. Once the order is received the Order/Line manager assigns the order to a cook. Once the order is completed it’s marked and removed from the list of orders from the cook list (similar to the burger HW). The manager, would have a dashboard that will involve creating, updating, deleting items on the menu. Also manage employees i.e., who get to be assigned a line cook from a list of employees. Last but not the least a dashboard with the following visualization on the KPIs:

* Revenue per day/month
* No. of orders per day
* Time to serve customer

This will have three views, i.e., send out three HTML files:
* menu.html – Simple and easy interface to get orders 
* Cart.html - file cart to display order and submit order
* Manager – Dashboard providing visualization, KPIs and CRUD operations on items
